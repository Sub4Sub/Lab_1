                The first project displayed on our website is a windows point form application called Modulus. The purpose of modulus is to 
                help organize a food businesses inventory and to keep track of any product being wasted. This is achieved by first storing all of 
                the food and inventory in a database, then every week all unused and/or wasted food is tracked in a report. Finally, 
                these reports are merged together and displayed as a monthly report. 
              </p>

                The second project to be displayed on our website is a website that utilizes HTML, php and postgres sql to create a website that 
                 allows salesperson so sign-in and log information about their sales history. This site includes multiple user types, such as admin
                 and salesperson, and contains many functions and features, such as resetting a users password, adding clients, displaying user or client info in tables and 
                 logging calls with clients in real time.
